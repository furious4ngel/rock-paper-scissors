The Odin Project project: Rock-Paper-Scissors
This repository contains a program that executes a basic 5-round game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. It is played in the console against the computer.

The program utilizes functions to emulate the classic game, including those that generate a choice from the computer, accept user input, and determine a winner from each round played and each endgame.
