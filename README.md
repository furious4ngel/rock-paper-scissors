# The Odin Project: Rock-Paper-Scissors
This repository contains a program that executes a game of 'Rock, Paper Scissors'.

## What I Learned - Rock, Paper, Scissors (Console)
I found styling console logs to be a neat console feature. I was able to differentiate between a game win and game loss for the user. When the user won the game, the log's text was green, and when they lost, the log's text was red.

## What I Learned - Revisiting Rock, Paper, Scissors (UI)
Functions really helped me organize my code by, well, function. For the UI, I utilized functions to start a game, display round results, and game scores, to describe a few of them. Functions forced me to think about scope - *which variables needed to have global scope or function/block scope?* Thinking this way will help me figure out how my own functions and variables work together in future projects.

DOM manipulation took time to get familiar with, but it's very useful for bringing life to even the simplest webpage. There are many methods and properties involved with the DOM, so, again, functions will benefit in maintaining clean code.
